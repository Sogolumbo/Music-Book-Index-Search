# Music-Book-Index-Search
### A small program to search for songs in music book pdfs.

The program provides a simple search algorithm to find the songs you are searching for. You can go straight to the pdf page with just a double click.
## How it works
The system is based on .csv index files. There are many index files for The Real Book and other common jazz music books in [book-indices](https://github.com/aspiers/book-indices).
The pdf viewer which is used to display the music books is [SumatraPDF](https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org) which is really light weight.

## Setup
1. Download [SumatraPDF](https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org).
2. Get the .csv files with the indices for your music books (download from [book-indices](https://github.com/aspiers/book-indices) or create your own).
3. Get the Music-Book-Index-Search exe.
4. Open Music-Book-Index-Search and go to Options.
5. Select your music book pdf file and the corresponding index csv file and add them.

Finished - you can now search your music sheet library.
